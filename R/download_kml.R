#'Download kml files
#'
#'@description Downloads map data from in kml format and writes it to a temporary directory.  You must specify a temporary directory to write files to in your options.  
#' 
#' @import httr
#' @importFrom utils txtProgressBar setTxtProgressBar
#' @param locator The a vector of ISO3 country code's that you want data about. (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm) or the basin ID's [1-468] (http://data.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/climate_data_api_basins.pdf)
#' @details kml files can be quite large making downloading them every time you want to make a map time consuming.  To 
#' reduce this time it's easiest to download kml files and store them.  To set the directory use a line like this: \code{options(kmlpath="/Users/emh/kmltemp")}  The option must be called "kmlpath".
